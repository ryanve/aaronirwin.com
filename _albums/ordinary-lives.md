# Ordinary Lives (2014)

<q>I apologize for this brief intrusion, however, I am writing to let you know that regardless of all common sense, I have again spent time and effort in writing and recording some original jazz music which I would like to share with you. The album is called Ordinary Lives, and it is my third recording on [Fresh Sound New Talent](https://www.freshsoundrecords.com/12360-aaron-irwin-albums). I am really proud of how this came together and also think that the musicians helping me in this endeavor sound simply fantastic. It was a quite rewarding process and I would be honored if you were to check it out.</q> –Aaron Irwin
